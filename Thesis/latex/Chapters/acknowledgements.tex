I would like to thank my family for their constant support and encouragement throughout the whole process of this thesis.

I am very grateful to my advisor, Ricardo Gonçalves, and my co-advisor, João Costa Seco, for their availability, guidance, and the time they dedicated to helping me with this project.

I also thank all the teachers and students who participated in the test sessions of the tool and shared their valuable feedback.

A special thanks goes to my friend João Pedro for his collaboration and for always motivating me during this journey.

I am also thankful to João Lourenço for developing and making available the thesis template, which was a great help during the writing stage.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT, which I used mainly to correct grammatical errors and to improve the clarity and smoothness of my text.

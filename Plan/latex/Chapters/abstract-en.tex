Logic is a core topic in areas like mathematics and computer science and is a key discipline in the computer science curriculum. In this context, students and teachers often lack tools to complement logic classes, especially for practicing exercises, as it is not always possible for students to interact with teachers to address their difficulties.

Online courses are a good example of tools that provide accessible resources to a wide variety of people. However, in the field of logic, these courses typically do not allow for the addition of new material and are often limited in the number of exercises. Logic includes various kinds of exercises, with natural deduction posing the greatest challenges for students. Unfortunately, there are no tools available to support these exercises. Additionally, many of these tools lack effective feedback mechanisms.

Developing an effective feedback system is essential to achieving a successful tool. However, it is a challenging task, as we do not want a system where students are always dependent on the feedback and stop thinking by themselves, but at the same time, we do not want them to lose interest in learning because they are always stuck in exercises.

In this thesis, we propose the development of an interactive online tool whose goal is to help students practice logic exercises. We want a system that is meant for everyone, from the novice user that is starting their journey in learning logic to the experienced user that wants to improve even more their skills. Our primary focus will be on creating an effective feedback system that will guide students throughout the construction of proofs. Additionally, we aim to enable the creation and evaluation of natural deduction exercises. The tool will support future expansions for new exercises and will be integrated with e-learning platforms like Moodle for class and grade management.

With this project, we want students to have a studying tool that is accessible to everyone and capable of assisting them in overcoming, in an efficient and engaging way, the challenges they face in logic exercises.

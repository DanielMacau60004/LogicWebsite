Citing something online~\cite{arxivIltisLearning,arxiv}.

\textcolor{red}{
    This thesis will focus on the implementation and design of various types of exercises commonly found in introductory logic courses, both in PL and FOL. The system should be interactive, allowing students to automatically check their solutions, and, most importantly, it has to provide advanced assistance by delivering detailed feedback and hints without disclosing the correct answers. It also must provide an interface for teachers to add new exercises and automatically grade them.
